    <h1 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <details>
      <summary>The Pink Gold of the Himalayas: A Pure Alternative to Table Salt</summary>
      <p>
        Himalayan pink salt is a mineral-rich salt mined from ancient sea beds
        in the Himalayan foothills. Untouched by modern pollution, its natural
        pink colour reflects the presence of valuable trace minerals.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How Is Himalayan Pink Salt Better Than Normal Table Salt?</summary>
      <p>
        Normal table salt is heavily refined and stripped of minerals, often
        containing anti-caking agents. Himalayan salt is minimally processed
        and retains essential minerals like potassium, magnesium, calcium,
        and iron.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why Should You Prefer Himalayan Salt?</summary>
      <p>
        Himalayan salt offers a cleaner seasoning without artificial additives,
        a softer and more balanced flavour, and better dietary balance that
        supports hydration and muscle function.
      </p>
